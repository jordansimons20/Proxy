# Proxy
Proxy web server. 

This proxy web server has been developed entirely in C, and follows the attached UML model.
Currently, the server is able to fulfill GET, POST, and PUT HTTP requests. 
The server currently cannot handle Partial Content responses, which will be a future implementation.

To run, simply use the attached makefile, and run the server. The server uses port 8080.
