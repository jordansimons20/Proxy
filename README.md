# Proxy
Proxy web server. 

This branch is the prototype of the proxy web server project.
As development continues, this branch will remain. 
The prototype simply creates a server, and displays an HTTP request to the user, or stops the server via signal. 
The events are decided at random.
The prototype lacks actual proxy functionality, but serves as a foundation with the architectual design implemented.

To run, simply use the attached makefile, and run the server. The server uses port 8080.
